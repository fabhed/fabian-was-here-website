I will create a simple static website using Python and the Flask web framework. The website will display "Fabian was here" on the home page and listen on port 80.

First, let's create the necessary files and folders for the project:

1. main.py: The entry point of the application.
2. templates/: A folder to store the HTML templates.
3. templates/index.html: The HTML template for the home page.
4. requirements.txt: The file containing the required packages for the project.

Now, let's write the code for each file:

main.py
