I will create a simple static website using Python and the Flask web framework. The website will display "Fabian was here" on the home page and listen on port 80.

First, let's create the necessary files and folders for the project:

1. main.py: The entry point of the application.
2. templates/: A folder to store the HTML templates.
3. templates/index.html: The HTML template for the home page.
4. requirements.txt: The file containing the required packages for the project.

Now, let's write the code for each file:

main.py
```python
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=80)
```

templates/index.html
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Simple Static Website</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Fabian was here</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

requirements.txt
```
Flask==2.1.1
```

Now, follow these steps to run the project:

1. Install the required packages using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the main.py file:

```
python main.py
```

3. Open a web browser and visit http://localhost or http://127.0.0.1 to see the "Fabian was here" message on the home page.

Please note that running a web server on port 80 might require administrator privileges. If you encounter any issues, try running the command with administrator privileges or change the port number to a higher value (e.g., 8080).
